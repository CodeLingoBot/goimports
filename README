This tool updates your Go import lines, adding missing ones and
removing unreferenced ones.

     $ go get github.com/bradfitz/goimports

It's a fork of gofmt, and will also format your code, so it can be
used as a replacement for your gofmt-on-save hook in your editor.

For emacs, make sure you have the latest (Go 1.2) go-mode.el:
https://go.googlecode.com/hg/misc/emacs/go-mode.el

Then in your .emacs file:

   (setq gofmt-command "goimports")
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/you/goroot/misc/emacs/")
   (require 'go-mode-load)
   (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'gofmt-before-save)

Or for vim, set "gofmt_command" to "goimports":

    https://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=39c724dd7f252
    https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse#hg%2Fmisc%2Fvim
    etc

Happy hacking!

Caveats:

For removal, it assumes the import path base matches the package name,
which is best practice anyway, like:

    import "github.com/you/foo" // assumes this is package "foo"

If they don't match, explictly name the package name in your import
line:

    import foo "github.com/you/not-quite-foo"

These caveats might be fixed.
